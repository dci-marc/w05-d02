This Java code defines an `Employee` class that calculates bonuses based on the employee’s job type and performance metrics. Let’s break down each part of the code so that beginners can understand what it does.

### Package Declaration

```java
package org.digitalcareerinstitute;
```

The `package` statement organizes the code within a `package`, or a folder-like structure, here named `org.digitalcareerinstitute`. It helps in organizing classes and separating them into different categories or projects.

### Imports

```java
import java.text.DecimalFormat;
import java.util.Scanner;
```

- **`java.text.DecimalFormat`**: This import allows us to format numbers to specific decimal places, which will be used to display the bonus with two decimal points.
- **`java.util.Scanner`**: The `Scanner` class is used for taking input from the user. It reads information typed in by the user in the console.

### The `Employee` Class

```java
public class Employee {
    ...
}
```

This class, `Employee`, contains all the methods for querying employee details, calculating bonuses, and displaying results.

### `getEmployeeDetails` Method

```java
void getEmployeeDetails() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter job description: ");
    String job = sc.nextLine().toLowerCase();
    double bonus = 0;
```

The `getEmployeeDetails` method gathers information from the user and calculates their bonus. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Initialize Scanner**: `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);` allows us to read input from the user.
2. **Job Description Prompt**: `System.out.println("Enter job description: ");` asks the user for their job role (e.g., `sales`, `engineer`, `technician`).
3. **Get Job Description**: `String job = sc.nextLine().toLowerCase();` reads the job description and converts it to lowercase for easy comparison.

### `switch` Statement for Job Types

```java
switch (job) {
    case "sales":
        double sales = querySales(sc);
        bonus = calculateBonus(sales);
        break;
    case "engineer":
        int unitsSold = querySoldUnits(sc);
        bonus = calculateBonus(unitsSold);
        break;
    case "technician":
        int partsAssembled = queryPartsAssembled(sc);
        int employeeType = queryEmployeeStatus(sc);
        bonus = calculateBonus(partsAssembled, employeeType);
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Error! Bad input.");
}
```

The `switch` statement checks which job the user entered and executes the appropriate code:

- **`case "sales"`**: If the job is `sales`, it calls `querySales` to get the sales amount and then calculates the bonus based on that sales amount using `calculateBonus(double sales)`.
- **`case "engineer"`**: If the job is `engineer`, it asks for the number of units sold using `querySoldUnits` and calculates the bonus with `calculateBonus(int unitsSold)`.
- **`case "technician"`**: For `technician`, it queries both the number of parts assembled and whether the employee is full-time or part-time, using `queryPartsAssembled` and `queryEmployeeStatus`. It calculates the bonus based on these inputs with `calculateBonus(int partsAssembled, int employeeType)`.
- **`default`**: If the job is not recognized, it outputs an error message.

After the bonus calculation, it displays the result:

```java
System.out.println("Your bonus for this month is: " + bonus);
```

### Input-Querying Helper Methods

Each of the following helper methods uses `Scanner` to ask for specific information from the user:

1. **`queryPartsAssembled`**: Prompts for the number of parts assembled.
2. **`queryEmployeeStatus`**: Asks if the employee is full-time or part-time (1 for Full-time, 2 for Part-Time).
3. **`querySoldUnits`**: Asks for the number of units sold.
4. **`querySales`**: Asks for the total sales amount.

### Bonus Calculation Methods

There are three variations of `calculateBonus`, each tailored to a different metric.

#### `calculateBonus(double sales)`

```java
public static double calculateBonus(double sales) {
    if (sales <= 10000) {
        return sales;
    }
    return sales * 0.1;
}
```

For a sales job, this method calculates the bonus based on the sales amount:

- If sales are less than or equal to $10,000, the entire sales amount is returned as the bonus.
- If sales exceed $10,000, the bonus is 10% of the sales amount.

#### `calculateBonus(int unitsSold)`

```java
public static double calculateBonus(int unitsSold) {
    int unitsExtraDifference = unitsSold - 100;
    int salaryBonus = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < unitsSold; i++) {
        salaryBonus += 20;
    }

    if (unitsExtraDifference > 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= unitsExtraDifference; i++) {
            salaryBonus += 10;
        }
    }

    return salaryBonus;
}
```

For engineers, this method calculates the bonus based on units sold:

- **Base Bonus**: Adds $20 to the bonus for each unit sold.
- **Extra Bonus**: If units sold are above 100, an additional $10 is added for each unit beyond 100.

#### `calculateBonus(int partsAssembled, int employeeType)`

```java
public static double calculateBonus(int partsAssembled, int employeeType) {
    float bonus = 0.025F;
    float salaryBonus = 0;

    switch (employeeType) {
        case 1:
            if (partsAssembled > 700) {
                for (int i = 700-partsAssembled; i < 0; i++) {
                    salaryBonus += bonus;
                }
            }
        case 2:
            if (partsAssembled > 300) {
                for (int i = 300-partsAssembled; i < 0; i++) {
                    salaryBonus += bonus;
                }
            }
            break;
    }

    DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.00");
    return Float.parseFloat(df.format(salaryBonus));
}
```

For technicians, the bonus depends on the number of parts assembled and the employee’s type (full-time or part-time):

- **Full-time (`case 1`)**: If parts assembled are over 700, a small bonus (0.025) is added for each part beyond 700.
- **Part-time (`case 2`)**: If parts assembled are over 300, the same small bonus (0.025) is added for each part beyond 300.

Finally, the `DecimalFormat` class is used to round the bonus to two decimal places before returning it.

### Summary of Program Flow

1. **Employee’s job type and metrics are entered**.
2. **Appropriate `calculateBonus` method** is called based on job type.
3. **Bonus is calculated and displayed** on the console.

This program effectively calculates monthly bonuses for different employee roles based on individual performance metrics.
